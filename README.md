# Quest
Simpliest ever quest engine.

1. In `problems` folder create pairs of files `PROBLEMCODE` and `PROBLEMCODE.answer`. First holds description (arbitrary html), second -- answer.
2. In `teams` folder create file names with team names. They should store problems codes line by line.
3. Almost done. Don't forget to add something like `problems/FINISH` with final text.
4. Static resources can be stored in `static` folder and referenced as `/static/filename` from html.
